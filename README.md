# Openvswitch installation
In this repository I show how to install and configure Openvswitch in CentOS7. There are two different ways:
- With commands (manual installation): Installation and configuration step by step.
- With ansible (automated installation): You can find all the necessary files for an automated installation using Ansible.

The last version check was Openvswitch v2.11.0.
