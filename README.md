# Openvswitch installation
In this repository I show how to install and configure Openvswitch in CentOS7. I presented two different ways to install openvswitch:
- With commands (manual installation)
- With ansible (automated installation)

# Commands
In the folder commands you can find how install and configure Openvswitch step by step

# Ansible
In the folder ansible you can find all the necessary files for an automated installation of Openvswitch using Ansible
